# Social-Networking-Application-Server
Developing a social networking application by implementing client and server modules.
In this project, We developed a social networking application implementing client and server modules. 
(i) The Server module manages message transfers, notifications and friendship relationships among the users.
(ii) The Client module behaves as a user which adds/removes friends, accepts/rejects friendship requests, sends/receives messages and receives relevant notifications.
